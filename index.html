            <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells,
                    does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper
                    half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,
                    moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.</p>

                <p>"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."</p>

                <p>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark
                    from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it
                    across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away
                    the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man,
                    black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
                    Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to
                    the pillow.</p>

                <p>"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the
                    photograph."</p>

                <p>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so,"
                    said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"</p>

                <p>"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a
                    case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven
                    years in the force, but this really takes the cake."</p>

                <p>"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that,
                    therefore, I am illegally detained."</p>

                <p>"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to
                    have trusted your wife."</p>
