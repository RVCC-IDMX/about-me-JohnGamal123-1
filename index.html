            <h2>Excerpt</h2>

            <div>

                <p>I don't really have any hobbies, I work everyday of the week and I go to the gym morning and night when possible, if I really have some free time I go for a ride in my car and listen to music.</p>

                <p>I started going to the gym everyday at around May of this year and haven't stopped since, I've gotten into much better shape since and don't plan on stopping anytime soon, rather than sitting around and doing nothing or wasting time on things that aren't productive I would rather spend time hitting the gym instead.</p>

                <p>A while back I quit video games and officially dropped it ever since I started the gym but here and there I play when I have nothing to do, I grew up playing FPS games like CSGO, TF2, played Valorant when it came out, but most of all I played Fortnite competitively back in high school and played professional private matches ranking against high level players and twitch streamers at that time, eventually I gave that up to focus on more important things and moved on.</p>

                <p>Sports were never really my thing and I don't play any and I don't plan on getting back into it but I used to play basketball and I wasn't even that good but I played for a team in middle school for two years and that was it.</p>

                <p>Right now I have an LS400 but in the future I plan on buying a few more classic cars, I want to get a Mercedes S500 from the 90's era and definitely a Jaguar XJ, an Impala SS, and a few more. EVentually getting a garage full of classics is my plan.</p>

                <p>Sometimes I go to car auctions and see whats available to buy to keep or to sell them and sometimes I just go for fun and see what kind of cool/rare vehicles you can encounter and being able to check them out in person is much better than going to a dealer or even worse seeing it online.</p>

                <p>Once I'm done cutting I'm going to start lifting weights and bulk up on muscle to get a more defined physique because I've only been losing weight so far and losing all of the muscle mass in the process.</p>

                <p>I used to stream on Twitch and did YouTube back then when I played Fortnite competitively and actually got a decent amound of followers and views especially on social medias like Instagram and Twitter but eventually quitting leading to the destruction of those accounts making them dead now, I don't plan on going back to doing them anytime soon either as I moved on like I already said.</p>
