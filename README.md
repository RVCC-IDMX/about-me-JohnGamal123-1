Alright so for the project I was going to do a car theme only but added gym pictures and my old hobbies and a favorite move of mine, it's definitely not perfect but i'm glad with the finishing results. I added two YouTube videos to it about my car, 3 pictures of the car in the photo gallery. Then I added my gym pictures, added my favorite movie scarface, and made the hamburger icon and the contact forms fully functional and working. I would say the biggest trouble I had and still have is actually adding my favicon because I have tried multiple times and couldn't get it to work and it's pretty frustrating, I actually had trouble with my first photo gallery the for the majority of the website but in the end I realized that my section id shouldn't have spaces in between the words and once I fixed that I understood that I could edit and touch it up in CSS so that was also a lesson learned and helped me understand it more fluently. I definitely did enjoy creating this website though and learned how to make one in VScode, learned a lot about HTML and CSS.
